        The Hulk, one of Marvel's most iconic superheroes, is the alter ego of Dr. Bruce Banner, a brilliant but
        socially withdrawn scientist. His story is one of tragedy, rage, and inner conflict as he struggles to control
        the monster within. The Incredible hulk was created by

    <h3>Story</h3>

    <p>
        Bruce Banner was a genius scientist specializing in gamma radiation. While working on a Gamma Bomb (G-Bomb) for
        the U.S. military, he discovered a young boy, Rick Jones, had wandered onto the testing site. Without thinking,
        Banner rushed in to save him, absorbing an enormous amount of gamma radiation when the bomb exploded.
        <br><br>
        Instead of killing him, the radiation triggered a mutation in his DNA. From that moment on, whenever Banner
        experienced extreme anger or stress, he transformed into The Hulk, a massive green-skinned creature of
        unstoppable strength and pure rage.

    <h3>Hulk's poem</h3>

    <pre>
    ðŸ’š <i>The Rage of the Hulk ðŸ’¥

In shadows deep, where tempers rise,
A monster wakes with glowing eyes.
A gentle man, so kind, so wise,
Now lost beneath his furyâ€™s cries.

His fists can shake the tallest spires,
His roar ignites the world in fires.
Yet in his heart, a battle sways,
A mind at war, a soul that prays.

Through chaos, pain, and paths unknown,
He walks this world, yet walks alone.
For though heâ€™s feared, though strength is vast,
He longs for peaceâ€”but pain holds fast.

    ðŸ’š HULK SMASH! ðŸ’¥</i>
